## Data Structures

### [Node](https://github.com/abtkod/practice/blob/master/interview/datastructure/node.py)
* **BaseNode** - This is the super class for othe node classes. 
* **Node** - Fixed typed nodes with fixed number of children. It is used to enforce consistency among all nodes of the data structure.
* **NodeFlexible** - Felxible typed nodes with infinite number of children.

### [Linked List](https://github.com/abtkod/practice/blob/master/interview/datastructure/linked_list.py)
* **LinkedList** - This is the singly-linked list which only uses forward links to the next node.
  *  Time Complexity
* **LinkedListFast** - This is the doubly-linked list which uses both forward and backward links to the next and previous nodes. Here we are using both head and tail pointers to enhance the speed of appending and removing nodes to/from the end.

### [Tree](https://github.com/abtkod/practice/blob/master/interview/datastructure/tree.py)
